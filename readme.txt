== Frequently Asked Questions == 

It's too Simple to have a FAQ

== Using the plugin ==

Just place the code of Youtube video between [youtube]ID Code*[/youtube] (Standard View) or [youtubewd]ID Code*[/youtubewd] (WideScreen View) tags.
That's All! Just use it! 

*ID Code - You get it from Youtube link. For example, you have a link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIQWg6M2J10&rel=1 so your ID Code is UIQWg6M2J10

Other Features:
# If you need to change Flash Player window size just edit the plugin file (adjust: $width, $height, $widthwd, $heightwd)
# No Capture (Title with rating) on video
# No Search Results
# If video has HD mode it switches to it automatically
